This page gives a very brief tutorial on the Scala porgramming language.

## Classes, traits, objects and packages

...

## Source files, classfiles and the JVM

Scala sources are stored as `.scala` files.

 - packages should be reflected in directory structure, otherwise problems in eclipse
 - multiple classes in one file possible
 - usually one source file per class, or per class hierarchy

The scala compiler compiles `.scala` source files to `.class` files, like the Java compiler. ... classfiles are bytecode for the JVM, etc.
