title: Sbt Tutorial
---

We use sbt for building, testing, running and submitting assignments. This tutorial explains all sbt commands that you will use during our class. The [Tools Setup](view?page=ToolsSetup) page explains how to install sbt.

## Starting up sbt

In order to start sbt, open a terminal ("Command Prompt" in Windows) and navigate to the directory of the assignment you are working on. Typing `sbt` will open the sbt command prompt.

## Compiling your code

The `compile` task will compile the source code of the assignment which is located in the directory `src/main/scala`.

    > compile
    [info] Compiling 4 Scala sources to /Users/luc/example/target/scala-2.10.0-M5/classes...
    [success] Total time: 2 s, completed Aug 10, 2012 10:00:26 PM
    > 

If the source code contains errors, the error messages from the compiler will be displayed.


## Running the Scala interpreter

You can start the Scala interpreter inside sbt using the `console` task. The interpreter (also called REPL, for "read-eval-print loop") is useful for trying out snippets of Scala code. Note that the interpreter can only be started if there are no compilation errors in your code.

In order to quit the interpreter and get back to sbt, type `ctrl-d`.

    > console
    [info] Starting scala interpreter...
    Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0-M5 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_33).
    Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
    Type :help for more information.
    
    scala> println("Oh, hai!")
    Oh, hai!
    
    scala> val l = List(1, 2, 3)
    l: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)
    
    scala> val squares = l.map(x => x * x)
    squares: List[Int] = List(1, 4, 9)
    
    scala>

## Testing your code

The directory `src/test/scala` contains unit tests for the project. In order to run these tests in sbt, you can use the `test` command.



    > test
    [info] ListsSuite:
    [info] - one plus one is two
    [info] - sum of a few numbers *** FAILED ***
    [info]   3 did not equal 2 (ListsSuite.scala:23)
    [info] - max of a few numbers
    [error] Failed: : Total 3, Failed 1, Errors 0, Passed 2, Skipped 0
    [error] Failed tests:
    [error]   example.ListsSuite
    [error] {file:/Users/luc/example/}assignment/test:test: Tests unsuccessful
    [error] Total time: 5 s, completed Aug 10, 2012 10:19:53 PM
    > 


## Running your code

If your project has an object with a `main` method (or an object extending the trait `App`), then you can run the code in sbt easily by typing `run`. In case sbt finds multiple main methods, it will ask you which one you'd like to execute.

    > run
    Multiple main classes detected, select one to run:
    
     [1] example.Lists
     [2] example.M2
    
    Enter number: 1
    
    [info] Running example.Lists 
    main method!
    [success] Total time: 33 s, completed Aug 10, 2012 10:25:06 PM
    >


## Running the style checker

As part of the grading process, we rung a style checker on the submitted source code to find commond coding style issues. To make sure that your code conforms to all our style rules, you can run the style checker yourself before submitting. The sbt task `styleCheck` does exactly that.

    > styleCheck
    [info] Checking file /Users/luc/Documents/epfl/teaching/progfun/assignments/src/main/scala/example/Lists.scala... OK!
    [info] Processed 1 file(s)
    [info] Found 0 errors
    [info] Found 0 warnings
    [info] Style Score: 100 out of 100
    [success] Total time: 1 s, completed Aug 10, 2012 11:34:02 PM

## Submitting your solution to coursera

The sbt task `submit` allows you to submit your solution for the assignment. It will pack your source code into a `.jar` file and upload it to the coursera servers. Note that the code can only be submitted if there are no compilation errors.

The `submit` tasks takes two arguments: your e-mail address and the submission password. **NOTE**: the submission password is **not your login password**. Instead, it's a special password generated by coursera. It is available on the [Assignments](../assignment/index) page.
