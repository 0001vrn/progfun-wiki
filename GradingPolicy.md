For every assignment there is a soft deadline and a hard deadline.

You can **only** achieve the maximal score if you submit before the soft deadline. After that, a penalty of 20% will be applied for each day that has passed since the soft deadline. For instance, if you submit two days after the soft deadline, you can only achieve 60% of the maximal score. If you are 5 days late you will not obtain any points.

The hard deadline is defined to be 5 days after the soft deadline: no more submissions are accepted once the hard deadline has passed.


## Time Zones

Please be **careful about time zones**: every deadline is defined in the UTC time zone (UTC +00). Make sure you don't miss a deadline by forgetting to convert the time of a deadline to your local time zone.
